Problems and improvements:
	ESP antenna outside of the outline - should be moved
	ESP too far from SDIO pins - move to the middle of the board?
	Display top connector - move higher?
	Display breakout: replace one BL with VCC for easier solder jumpers
	Move display BL to ATMega?
	Display breakout - move breakout to lower connector
	UART RX&TX to testpoints?
	Fucked up transistor pinouts
	Too large diode on vibromotor
	ATMega - SMD crystal option for low profile
	ATMega - move keypad pins to programming pins? UART?
	ATMega - I2C to RPi I2C
	ATMega - make programming connections easier?
	Make pin headers that are obstructing USB?
	Reset button footprint for GSM modem
	Audio - make a simple header for a buffer, route R-C after that (with a way to jumper it) https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-raspberry-pi-zero/audio-outputs
	Audio - put bypass caps on top side?
	Audio - left channel and mic mixed up
	Audio - footprint made without holes
	Display: shift a header?
	Keypad layer: lower level button - footprint supporting both types of buttons
	Keypad layer: lower level buttons too far from keypad edge, hard to press
	Keypad layer: footprint not suitable for two-pin side buttons
	Keypad layer: I2C and various voltages on one more header going to top right corner of keypad.
	Keypad layer: make sure all pins are on 2.54 grid
	Keypad layer: bring arrow keys closer
