New things in front board v1.0:

	* Added 7-pin header for 1.3 SPI OLED display
	* Added trace closing the audio buffer override jumper
	* Lowered ATMega header pin count to 6 pins, one is selectable between ATMEGA_RST and ATMEGA_GPIO
	* Added a capacitor in series with ATMEGA_RST pin (for easier programming using off-the-shelf adapters)
	* Added a LED to ATMega PB5 (Arduino Pin 13) - optional, useful mostly for debugging
	* Added fiducials 
	* Moved traces to get a ground plane between I2C and SPI, as well as between SPI MOSI and SPI CLK
	* Moved GSM audio filtering capacitors near mic to other layer
	* Changed all 0603 footprints to handsoldering ones
	* Fixed audio jack silkscreen so that it's shown correctly at the back of the board
	* Added a hole for GSM speaker wires to go through
	* Adjusted traces to account for soldermask tolerances
	* Replaced 10uF with 100uF capacitors on schematic
	* On display headers, changed middle pin drills to be smaller (for easier soldering of displays)
	* Added place for audio-to-ground resistors (like on Pi 3)
	* Bigger holes in pin headers
	* Changed the pins for the new revision - freeing up I2S/SPI1 interface
	* Shifted ESP-12 a tad further into board outline
	* Added revision info text, MakeRiga reference, OSHW and hacker glider labels
	* Added basic audio jack ESD protection 
	* Modified audio jack output capacitor footprint so that 1206 would kinda fit
	* Fixed audio jack footprint

#CHECK GSM AUDIO PINOUT
#CHECK CONNECTORS - PLACEMENT 
#CHECK CONNECTORS (?)

	
New things in back board v1.0:
	Turned MCP23017 to 180 degrees, rearranged the GPIOs
	Removed I2C level shifting
	Powered MCP23017 and RGB LED from VBAT
	Added one more USB port
	Fixed expansion header silkscreen
	Swapped lots of pins on expansion headers
	One layer for ground&power, one for signals


Board TODOs

Left for next versions

	Footprint for smaller MCP23017?
	Change via drill/annular ring size near pads to make rework less problematic?
	Audio amplifier footprint?
	Replace RGB LED by WS2812?
	Add diodes on keypad board
	Switch on USB power - power USB from charger 5V input when on charger
	Add more clarifications to the board schematics
