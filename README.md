# ZeroPhone-PCBs
KiCad PCB files for ZeroPhone (NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION)

This is an alpha version. It was ordered, 12 PCBs of each order were produced and there, not surprisingly, were numerous changes to be made. They're all listed in the TODO and will be fixed in the next version. 

Do not order this unless you're prepared to cut traces, solder magnet wire, deadbug SMD passives, solder SMD transistors in the most wrong orientation imaginable and isolate pads from ICs with Kapton.

If you do order these PCBs, don't complain. Otherwise, just wait for the new revision.
