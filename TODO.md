#PCB TODO

* Back board: move GPIO expander to back
* Back board: move GSM modem to back to back
* Back board: move charging board to front
* Make a board for 18650 socket
* Rethink GPIO mapping one last time?
* Back board: make castellations/solder pads to solder charging MicroUSB port to (it already broke off one time for me)
* Back board: place for a jumper that interrupts BAT- / BAT+
* Front board: center display header
* Front board: un-hardwire 7-pin display header
* Front board: change ATMega GPIO to INT0-capable GPIO?
