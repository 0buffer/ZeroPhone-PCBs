#PCB TODO

* Back board: move GPIO expander to back
* Back board: move GSM modem to back to back
* Back board: move charging board to front
* Make a board for 18650 socket, with capability to be attached to ZeroPhone (mounting holes?)
* Back board: make castellations/solder pads to solder charging MicroUSB port to (it already broke off one time for me)
* Front board: center display header
* Front board: un-hardwire 7-pin display header
* Footprint for smaller MCP23017?
* Change via drill/annular ring size near pads to make rework less problematic
* Audio amplifier footprint?
* UART buffering?
* Comparators for voltage level measurement (DC-DC overcurrent, incapable charger, main battery shutdown)
* Replace RGB LED by WS2812?
* Add diodes on keypad board
* Switch on USB power - power USB from charger 5V input when on charger (starting with this)[http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva716/slva716.pdf]
* Add more clarifications to the board schematics
